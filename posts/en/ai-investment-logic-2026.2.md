## Key Insights

As the initial hype around raw compute power settles, the investment landscape for AI in 2026 has undergone a fundamental shift.

### From Compute to Energy

* **Vertical Integration**: General LLMs are no longer the sole focus.
* **Private Deployment**: Financial institutions are increasingly adopting localized Small Language Models (SLMs).
